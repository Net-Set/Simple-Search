# Simple Search
A very basic app designed for people who want to use a search widget with their preferred search engine.

This app contains a search bar to type in a search query, which will be opened in the Internet browser. A widget for the home screen will simply start the app.

You can change the search engine in the settings (Default is DuckDuckGo) or type in a custom search string. The app also saves the search queries as a history.
